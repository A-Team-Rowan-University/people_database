# People lib

This will have all of the types needed for people and the logic behind them.

The types are based off mario's databse specification. They will include all of the information that comes from the database. These will include things like `user`, `department`, etc.

The logic includes error validation and anything else that has to do with users. For example, you will need to ensure that each user has a valid department.
